            We gather the following information from you, personally identifiable information and non-personally
            identifiable information.

                Information knowingly provided by you through online forms, registration forms, surveys and/or other
                entries, such as your name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number (home, work and mobile),
                date of birth, Social Security Number, bank account information, information relating to monthly income,
                employment information, and other personal, financial or demographic information;
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies. As you navigate through and interact with this Website, we may use automatic data collection
                technologies ("Cookies") to collect certain information, including but not limited to, information about
                your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, operating system, internet connection and location data.
                The information we collect automatically may include personal information, and we may maintain it or
                compound it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. Cookies
                help us improve this Website so we are able to deliver a better and more personalized experience by
                reducing unwanted information that you might otherwise receive.

                Information (user-specific or aggregate) concerning the pages our visitors access and referring URLs;

                The e-mail addresses of visitors who communicate with this site and Steady Cash via e-mail.

        </ol>

        <p>
            Please note: Submitting information to us is voluntary and we may also collect your personally identifiable
            information when you submit information at the Website but do not complete the full registration process.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">How we use collected data</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            For the purposes of data usage, we use the information we collect to enhance your experience at our Website
            and to help us offer content we determine may be of interest to you. We use your contact information to
            offer you promotional material from our partners. We may also use your personal, demographic, and profile
            data to improve our Website, conduct statistical analysis, and for marketing, promotional, editorial, or
            feedback purposes. Information collected by us may be added to our databases and used for future emails or
            postal mailings of products and services.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">How we share your information</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            By providing your personally identifiable information, you allow us to process your request and connect you
            with a lender. That also means that we have the right to share this information with a third party because a
            lender cannot approve your loan without knowing anything about you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note: that lenders may verify your personal information by sending requests to national databases and
            credit reporting agencies. Such inquiries may affect your credit score. We may share some of your data with
            our affiliates, partners and other accredited third parties for the purposes of business management,
            security, advertising, marketing, consumer behavior analysis, and service improvement.
        </p>

        <p>
            We reserve the right to share your information with another company that has acquired our business, a part
            of it, or fused with us. In case such a situation takes place, it’s possible that we will inform you about
            these changes by email or with an announcement posted on our website. We may share your personally
            identifiable information if it is required by the law and is necessary to proceed with a legal process or to
            protect our rights.
        </p>

        <p>
            By collecting and sharing your non-personally identifiable information with third parties, we improve our
            technical service, study behavior of our customers and gather web statistics important to the management of
            our business. We may share it with other third parties for these purposes.
        </p>


        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Do Not Call Registry Compliance</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            It is every consumer’s right to add his or her telephone number to the National Do Not Call Registry, which,
            in general, applies to any plan, program, or campaign to sell goods or services through interstate phone
            calls. However, a company may call a consumer with whom it has an established business relationship for up
            to eighteen (18) months after the consumer’s last purchase, delivery or payment, and for up to three (3)
            months after the consumer submits an application or an inquiry to the company, even if the consumer’s number
            has been added to the National Do Not Call Registry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>maniloans.online</strong> does not make outbound phone calls to consumers, and therefore does not
            maintain an internal do not call registry of its own. If you no longer wish to receive phone calls from a
            lender you got connected with, you will have to contact them directly and request that your telephone number
            be placed on their specific do not call list.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Data Retention and Security</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you with products and Services, and to
            comply with our accounting and legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Your
            Personal Information will be destroyed or permanently deleted as required by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>maniloans.online</strong> uses reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures
            to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your information.
            Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. While we
            strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of
            any Personal Information you transmit to us.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Links to Third-Party Websites</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Our Website, as well as the email messages sent with respect to our Services, may contain links or access to
            websites operated by third parties that are beyond our control. For example, if you click to request for a
            product such as a loan via <strong>maniloans.online</strong>, you may be linked to a third-party website to
            complete a request. Links or access to third parties from our Services are not an endorsement by us of such
            third parties, or their websites, requests, products, services, or practices. We are not responsible for the
            privacy policy, terms and conditions, practices or the content of such third parties.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">E-Consent</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Please read carefully and acknowledge this important information which might help you for future reference.
        </p>
        <p>
            By participating in this website and clicking the ‘Request Now’ button, you agree to provide your personal
            details to request to be in touch with our lender and you have received and reviewed this E-Consent Policy,
            and that you consent to conduct transactions using electronic signatures, electronic disclosures, electronic
            records, and electronic contract documents (‘Disclosures’). In the attempt of connecting you with the
            lender, the lenders need your consent to use and accept electronic signatures, records, and disclosures
            (‘E-Consent’).
        </p>

        <p>Option for Paper or Non-Electronic Records.</p>

        <p>
            Your provided information will be shared with participating lenders, third-party partners including
            advertisers, networks and others who may not provide financial solutions, the connection between you and the
            information-shared partners may be on any mobile device, including phones, smart-phones, tablets, and any
            other electronic device that allows the consumer to connect to the Internet. There is no guarantee by the
            owner of this website about the approved loans. By exercising this E-Consent, these 3rd parties may process
            your information and interact during all online interactions with you electronically.
        </p>
        <p>
            They may also send you notices electronically related to its interactions and transactions. Disclosures may
            be provided online at your lender’s website, if applicable, and may be provided by e-mail. See above for
            guidance on how to request paper copies.
        </p>

        <p>Consenting to Do Business Electronically.</p>
        <p>
            Prior to the final business decision with the lender, it is important for you to consider these two points
            below:

        <ul>
            <li>Conduct business electronically</li>
            <li>Require hardware and software capabilities described as below.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hardware and Software Requirements.</p>
        <p>
            To access and retain the Disclosures and Communications electronically, you will need to use the following
            computer software and hardware:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Adobe Acrobat Reader 6 or higher</li>
            <li>Ability to Print</li>
            <li>Internet Explorer 8 or higher</li>
            <li>Email Access</li>

        </p>

        <p>Withdrawing Consent.</p>
        <p>
            If you are connected with one or more third-party lenders, you are free to withdraw your E-Consent with
            those lenders at any time, and at no charge. However, if you withdraw the E-Consent before being connected
            with a lender, you may be prevented from obtaining an offer as this consent is required, for this one time
            transaction, to facilitate the connection and to conduct business. Contact your lender directly if you wish
            to withdraw this E-Consent. If you decide to withdraw this E-Consent, the legal effectiveness, validity, and
            enforceability of prior electronic disclosures will not be affected.
        </p>

        <p>

            electronic address or physical mailing address. Your lender will have specific instructions on how to update
            your contact information, if necessary. Please note that <strong>maniloans.online</strong> cannot update
            your information for you.

                Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>1. What is Mani Online Loans?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mani Online Loans</strong> is a cash advance and personal loan online referral service on our
                website.

                If a customer is looking for a cash advance or personal loan online, we help connect them with a
                marketplace of companies who offer personal loans and cash advances. Our website features a secure form
                requesting information that lenders and/or lending partners within our cash advance and personal loan
                referral marketplace will use to decide whether they want to offer a customer a cash advance or personal
                loan. The information that they need in order to make cash advance or personal loan decisions about each
                customer includes name, address, home and work phone numbers, and email address. They also need a
                customer's birth date and social security number to comply with the US Patriot Act. The operator of this
                website can be reached by mail at Mani Online Loans, 2803 Philadelphia Pike, Suite B #1020, Claymont,
                DE 19703, United States or by email. Customers can contact us if they want to discontinue using our loan
                referral service, or to change their communication preferences. Any questions about cash advance or
                personal loan amounts should be directed to the company from which a customer obtained his or her cash
                advance or personal loan.</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>2. How much will the loan cost?</strong></p>
            <p>The cost of the loan and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend on several factors including but not limited
                to, credit history, stable source of income, and state law. Your APR also depends on how much you want
                to borrow and how quickly you want to repay the loan.
                The terms of your loan are disclosed during the loan request process when you are directed to the
                lender's and/or lending partner's loan agreement. This information is strictly between you and your
                lender and/or lending partner. Not all customers will be eligible for a loan or meet the criteria to
                receive the best terms or lowest interest rate.</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>3. How soon can a personal loan or cash advance be made
                    available?</strong></p>
            <p>The time it takes to process a loan and transfer or ACH funds into an individual's account varies with
                each loan company, and also depends on the financial institution where the customer has their bank
                account. However, approved individuals can often receive their loan as soon as the next business day
                after approval.</p>






            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>4. Why are you collecting my SSN and Bank Details?</strong></p>

            <p>Our network of lenders use your SSN and bank details to help them make a decision about whether or not to
                extend you a loan offer. The bank details also help the lender that you are connected to know how to
                send money to your account. Our websites are encrypted using industry recognized encryption technology
                to help keep your information safe. Additionally, lenders use the SSN to help ensure the identity of the
                applicant is really the person they say they are.</p>



            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>5. Are you a lender?</strong></p>
            <p>No, we are not a lender. We work with several lenders to make up a network that can help you to find a
                loan. After submitting a request, if accepted, we will forward you to the lender's website where you
                will be able to learn more about your specific loan offer.</p>




            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>6. What if I have bad credit?</strong></p>
            <p>We attempt to connect consumers with lenders regardless of your credit history. Requirements needed for a
                loan approval is based on each individual lender. Please review our How It Works page to determine if
                you have the basic requirements to qualify.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>7. Where do I find my ABA / Routing Number & account number?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Please see the diagram below for instructions on how to find the information from your check book.
                Alternatively please call your bank for more information.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>8. What Happens If I Do Not Pay (Implications Of Non-Payment)?</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Late/Partial Payments:</strong> IIf you do not pay the full amount of principal and interest by
                the agreed-upon payment date, you will likely be charged a new finance charge and payment date may be
                extended until your next pay date. This new finance charge may be a flat fee, or may be calculated by
                applying the proportionate amount of the finance charge to the unpaid loan amount. Review the late
                payment policy detailed in the loan documents provided to you by your lender and/or lending partner
                before signing your e-signature, and thereby agreeing to the loan terms.</p>
            <p><strong>No-Payment:</strong>Mani Online Loans does not enforce payment. If you do not pay, your lender
                and/or lending partner may take legal action against you. Additional fees may apply to you in the event
                that you are unable to repay your loan. Information regarding your payment history, delinquency or
                defaults on the account may be reported to a third party consumer reporting agency and may impact your
                credit rating.</p>
            <p><strong>Loan Renewals:</strong>Mani Online Loans will not provide a renewal for you. Your lender
                and/or lending partner has renewal policies which will vary. With every extension or renewal, a new
                finance charge ("Extension Fee") may be assessed by the lender and/or lending partner, and the
                re-payment date may be extended until the borrower's next pay date. The finance charges can be
                significant depending on the lender and/or lending partner.</p>

            <p><strong>Collection Practices:</strong>Collections practices of lenders and/or lending partners and/or any
                assignee(s) will be in accordance with the principles of applicable federal regulations. Lenders and/or
                lending partners may attempt to contact borrowers via one or more authorized methods, including phone
                calls and emails, to arrange for payment. Impact to Credit Score: Your lender and/or lending partner may
                report late or missed payments to the credit bureaus. This can negatively affect your credit score.
                Consumers with credit difficulties should seek credit counseling.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>9. What Are Personal Loans Or Installment Loans?</strong></p>
            <p>Personal and/or installment loans typically range between $100 and $5,000. They can be used for almost
                any personal expense, from paying off credit cards and medical bills to financing home repairs or even a
                much-needed vacation. Personal loans are commonly called installment loans because they are typically
                paid back in monthly or bi-monthly installments over an extended period of time. They can be a
                convenient alternative to bank loans or high-interest credit cards, with online loan request forms and
                no-hassle automated repayment.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>10. How Much Can I Receive?</strong></p>
            <p>Qualified loan amounts can vary and are based on personal eligibility. Approved loan amounts can range
                between $100 to $5,000.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>11. What is the cost?</strong></p>
            <p>There is no cost to use maniloans.online. The fees of the loan will vary depending upon the amount and
                the
                lender. The lender will inform you of the fees for the loan which may vary depending on the lender.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>12. Loan Renewal Policies</strong></p>
            <p>Loan renewal options are not always available. It is therefore advisable to clarify whether the option is
                available with your lender. Be sure to carefully peruse the renewal policy presented in the agreement
                before you sign the documents.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>13. Representative Example of APR</strong></p>
            <p>If you borrow $2,500 over a term of 1 year with an APR of 10% and a fee of 3%, you will pay $219,79 each
                month. The total amount payable will be $2,637, with a total interest of $137,48.</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>14. Collection Practices</strong></p>

                Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>1. What is Mani  Online Loans?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mani  Online Loans</strong> is a cash advance and personal loan online referral service on our
                website.

                If a customer is looking for a cash advance or personal loan online, we help connect them with a
                marketplace of companies who offer personal loans and cash advances. Our website features a secure form
                requesting information that lenders and/or lending partners within our cash advance and personal loan
                referral marketplace will use to decide whether they want to offer a customer a cash advance or personal
                loan. The information that they need in order to make cash advance or personal loan decisions about each
                customer includes name, address, home and work phone numbers, and email address. They also need a
                customer's birth date and social security number to comply with the US Patriot Act. The operator of this
                website can be reached by mail at Mani  Online Loans, 2803 Philadelphia Pike, Suite B #1020, Claymont,
                DE 19703, United States or by email. Customers can contact us if they want to discontinue using our loan
                referral service, or to change their communication preferences. Any questions about cash advance or
                personal loan amounts should be directed to the company from which a customer obtained his or her cash
                advance or personal loan.</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>2. How much will the loan cost?</strong></p>
            <p>The cost of the loan and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend on several factors including but not limited
                to, credit history, stable source of income, and state law. Your APR also depends on how much you want
                to borrow and how quickly you want to repay the loan.
                The terms of your loan are disclosed during the loan request process when you are directed to the
                lender's and/or lending partner's loan agreement. This information is strictly between you and your
                lender and/or lending partner. Not all customers will be eligible for a loan or meet the criteria to
                receive the best terms or lowest interest rate.</p>

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>3. How soon can a personal loan or cash advance be made
                    available?</strong></p>
            <p>The time it takes to process a loan and transfer or ACH funds into an individual's account varies with
                each loan company, and also depends on the financial institution where the customer has their bank
                account. However, approved individuals can often receive their loan as soon as the next business day
                after approval.</p>






            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>4. Why are you collecting my SSN and Bank Details?</strong></p>

            <p>Our network of lenders use your SSN and bank details to help them make a decision about whether or not to
                extend you a loan offer. The bank details also help the lender that you are connected to know how to
                send money to your account. Our websites are encrypted using industry recognized encryption technology
                to help keep your information safe. Additionally, lenders use the SSN to help ensure the identity of the
                applicant is really the person they say they are.</p>



            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>5. Are you a lender?</strong></p>
            <p>No, we are not a lender. We work with several lenders to make up a network that can help you to find a
                loan. After submitting a request, if accepted, we will forward you to the lender's website where you
                will be able to learn more about your specific loan offer.</p>




            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>6. What if I have bad credit?</strong></p>
            <p>We attempt to connect consumers with lenders regardless of your credit history. Requirements needed for a
                loan approval is based on each individual lender. Please review our How It Works page to determine if
                you have the basic requirements to qualify.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>7. Where do I find my ABA / Routing Number & account number?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Please see the diagram below for instructions on how to find the information from your check book.
                Alternatively please call your bank for more information.</p>
           

            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>8. What Happens If I Do Not Pay (Implications Of Non-Payment)?</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Late/Partial Payments:</strong> IIf you do not pay the full amount of principal and interest by
                the agreed-upon payment date, you will likely be charged a new finance charge and payment date may be
                extended until your next pay date. This new finance charge may be a flat fee, or may be calculated by
                applying the proportionate amount of the finance charge to the unpaid loan amount. Review the late
                payment policy detailed in the loan documents provided to you by your lender and/or lending partner
                before signing your e-signature, and thereby agreeing to the loan terms.</p>
            <p><strong>No-Payment:</strong>Mani  Online Loans does not enforce payment. If you do not pay, your lender
                and/or lending partner may take legal action against you. Additional fees may apply to you in the event
                that you are unable to repay your loan. Information regarding your payment history, delinquency or
                defaults on the account may be reported to a third party consumer reporting agency and may impact your
                credit rating.</p>
            <p><strong>Loan Renewals:</strong>Mani  Online Loans will not provide a renewal for you. Your lender
                and/or lending partner has renewal policies which will vary. With every extension or renewal, a new
                finance charge ("Extension Fee") may be assessed by the lender and/or lending partner, and the
                re-payment date may be extended until the borrower's next pay date. The finance charges can be
                significant depending on the lender and/or lending partner.</p>

            <p><strong>Collection Practices:</strong>Collections practices of lenders and/or lending partners and/or any
                assignee(s) will be in accordance with the principles of applicable federal regulations. Lenders and/or
                lending partners may attempt to contact borrowers via one or more authorized methods, including phone
                calls and emails, to arrange for payment. Impact to Credit Score: Your lender and/or lending partner may
                report late or missed payments to the credit bureaus. This can negatively affect your credit score.
                Consumers with credit difficulties should seek credit counseling.</p>


            <p style="margin: 20px 0px;"><strong>9. What Are Personal Loans Or Installment Loans?</strong></p>
            <p>Personal and/or installment loans typically range between $100 and $5,000. They can be used for almost
                any personal expense, from paying off credit cards and medical bills to financing home repairs or even a
                much-needed vacation. Personal loans are commonly called installment loans because they are typically
                paid back in monthly or bi-monthly installments over an extended period of time. They can be a
                convenient alternative to bank loans or high-interest credit cards, with online loan request forms and
                no-hassle automated repayment.</p>
